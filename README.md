## Project Overview

This project focuses on validating **core banking APIs** using a combination of **RestAssured** and **Postman**. The main goal is to ensure robust API functionality, accurate data responses, and error-free execution.

Key highlights:  
- Performed **request/response validation** for all core banking endpoints.  
- Verified **schema consistency** and **status codes** for reliability.  
- Handled **error scenarios** to ensure APIs respond gracefully under invalid or unexpected input.  
- Integrated scripts with **Maven** and **TestNG** for structured automation.  
- Generated **clean HTML automation reports** for quick review of results.
